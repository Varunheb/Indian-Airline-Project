        Jet Airways (India) Ltd is an Indian international airline based in
        Mumbai. It was one of the largest airline in India, with a 21.2%
        passenger market share in February 2016. It operated over 300 flights
        daily to 74 destinations worldwide from its main hub at Chhatrapati
        Shivaji International Airport and secondary hubs at Chennai
        International Airport, Indira Gandhi International Airport, Kempegowda
        International Airport and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International
        Airport. Incorporated in April 1992 as a limited liability company, the
        airline began operations as an air taxi operator in 1993. It began
        full-fledged operations in 1995 with international flights added in
        2004.

      <h2 class="bcs">History</h2>
      <p class="bcsp">
        The airline was granted a scheduled airline status on 14 January 1995.
        It entered into a marketing agreement with KLM the same year. In 1996,
        the airline placed a $375 million order for four 737-400 and six 737-800
        aircraft from Boeing, which were delivered between 1997 and 2000. Jet
        Airways was the first airline in Southeast Asia to order the 737-800. In
        the financial year 1996–97, the airline carried 2.4 million passengers
        and had a market share of 20 percent, second highest after state-owned
        Indian Airlines. By this time, the airline had a fleet of twelve Boeing
        737 aircraft, operating 83 daily flights to 23 domestic destinations. In
        1997, the Cabinet Committee on Foreign Investment (CCFI) of the
        Government of India announced that foreign airlines would no longer be
        permitted to take an equity stake in joint ventures with Indian aviation
        companies, reversing the Government's earlier policy which had allowed
        carriers such as Gulf Air, Kuwait Airways and Lufthansa to hold a
        maximum 40% equity stake in their joint ventures with Indian partners.
        In October 1997, as per this directive, Naresh Goyal took back control
        of Trade Winds from its foreign investors. At the Paris Air Show in June
        1999, Jet Airways announced an order worth approximately $550 million
        for ten Boeing 737-800 aircraft. The airline purchased its first Boeing
        737-400 simulator from CAE Inc. in 2001. By April 2001, the airline
        fleet had grown to 30 aircraft and was operating over 195 flights daily
        to 37 destinations within India. Jet Airways suffered losses for the
        first time since its establishment in financial year 2001–2002 as demand
        fell and costs increased. Jet Airways was announced as launch customer
        for the Embraer 175 at the Farnborough air show in 2002, with an order
        for ten aircraft and ten options worth $520 million. But the deal was
        postponed due to the airline's financial difficulties and eventually
        fell through. In 2003, the Indian government decided to allow private
        carriers to operate international services to countries in south Asia,
        such as Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. and Jet began preparations to
        launch international services. The airline launched its first
        international flight in March 2004 from Chennai to Colombo. Jet Airways
        was listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and became public company on 28
        December 2004. After the Government lifted the foreign ownership limits
        on Indian airlines to 49% from the previous 40%, the airline moved to
        raise funds via an IPO. The company's IPO in February 2005, which
        offered 20% of the airline's stock, saw strong interest from investors
        leading to oversubscription in retail, non-institutional and
        institutional tranches and raised Rs 18.9 billion, instantly making
        Naresh Goyal a paper billionaire. Towards the end of 2004, the
        government had announced that privately owned scheduled carriers meeting
        certain criteria could operate to all countries apart from those in the
        Middle East. Then in January 2005, the Ministry of Civil Aviation
        granted rights to Jet Airways to operate services to London Heathrow.
        The airline started its first international, long-haul flight to London
        in May 2005 with two-class Airbus A340-300s sub-leased from South
        African Airways.

      <h3 class="bcs">Growth and Expansion</h3>
      <p class="bcsp">
        In January 2006, Jet Airways announced its intention to acquire Air
        Sahara for US$500 million in an all-cash deal; however, the deal fell
        through in June 2006. On 12 April 2007, the deal was back on track with
        Jet Airways agreeing to pay ₹14.5 billion (US$200 million). On 16 April
        2007, Air Sahara was renamed as JetLite and was marketed between a
        low-cost carrier and a full-service airline. JetLite became a wholly
        owned subsidiary of Jet Airways. In August 2008, Jet Airways announced
        its plans to integrate JetLite into Jet Airways. In October 2008, Jet
        Airways laid off 1,900 of its employees, who were later re-instated due
        to intervention from the Ministry of Civil Aviation. In October 2008,
        Jet Airways entered into an alliance with rival Kingfisher Airlines for
        code-sharing on domestic and international flights, collaboration on
        frequent-flyer program and sharing crew and ground handling equipment.
        On 8 May 2009, Jet Airways launched another low-cost brand, Jet Konnect.
        It operated a fleet of Boeing 737 Next Generation and ATR 72 aircraft
        and operated on profitable short-haul routes with higher passenger load
        factors.

      <h4 class="bcs">International Destinations</h4>
      <p class="bcsp">
        Jet Airways serves 57 destinations incuding 37 domestic and 20
        International. Jet Airways flies to countries like U.K, France,
        Belgium,Italy, Austria, Norway, Canada, China, South Africa, Netherlands
        and some Gulf countries ect.

      <h3 class="bcs">Bankrupt and Cessation of Servises</h3>
      <p class="bcsp">
        As of November 2018, Jet Airways has been reported to have a negative
        financial outlook due to increasing losses. In March 2019 it was
        reported that nearly a fourth of Jet Airways' aircraft were grounded due
        to unpaid lease rates. On 25 March 2019, Mr. Naresh Goyal and his wife
        Anitha Goyal stepped down from the board of directors. On 5 April,
        Indian Oil Corporation stopped supplying fuel to the airline, citing
        non-payment of dues as the emergency funds have still not been credited.
        On 17 April, the airline suspended all flight operations, due to lenders
        rejecting Rs 4 billion of emergency funding and its membership in the
        International Air Transport Association was suspended. On 17 June, after
        getting no acceptable offers from Etihad Airways and Hinduja Group,
        lenders to Jet Airways decided to refer the company to National Company
        Law Tribunal for bankruptcy proceedings with debt of $1.2 billion. As
        the group faces insolvency proceedings in the Netherlands after failing
        to pay two creditors, NCLAT (National Company Law Appellate Tribunal)
        has allowed cross-border insolvency proceedings stating that the "Dutch
        Trustee (Administrator) will work in cooperation with the 'Resolution
        Professional of India. In early 2020, Enso Group, tried to rescue the
        airline with Russian Far East Development Fund, and participated in
        talks for buying controlling stake in it from its committee of
        creditors(CoC), but talks fell through.

      <h4 class="bcs">Restart Of Jet Airways</h4>
      <p class="bcsp">
        India's Jet Airways will resume flights by the end of 2021 after its
        creditors approved a bid from entrepreneur Murari Lal Jalan and asset
        management firm Kalrock, which is part of the Fritsch Group, an
        investment group founded by serial real estate and tech entrepreneur
        Florian Fritsch. Following this, on 22 June 2021, the NCLT approved the
        resolution put forward by Kalrock-Jalan consortium. In an oral order,
        the NCLT has given 90 days to the Ministry of Civil Aviation and the
        Directorate General of Civil Aviation for allotting airport slots to Jet
        Airways.
