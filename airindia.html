      <h2 class="ht">Early Years</h2>
      <p>
        Air India is the oldest Airline in India. This Airline was started by
        J.R.D.Tata, an Indian Aviator and buisiness tycoon. In April 1932, Tata
        won a contract to carry mail for Imperial Airways and the aviation
        department of Tata Sons was formed with two single-engine de Havilland
        Puss Moths.On 15 October 1932, Tata flew a Puss Moth carrying air mail
        from Karachi to Bombay (currently Mumbai) and the aircraft continued to
        Madras (currently Chennai) piloted by Nevill Vintcent, a former Royal
        Air Force pilot and friend of Tata. The airline fleet consisted of a
        Puss Moth aircraft and a de Havilland Leopard Moth. Initial service
        included weekly airmail service between Karachi and Madras via Ahmedabad
        and Bombay. In its first year of operation, the airline flew 160,000
        miles (260,000 km), carrying 155 passengers and 9.72 tonnes (10.71 tons)
        of mail and made a profit of â‚¹60,000.

      <h2 class="hw">As Air India</h2>
      <p class="p-2">
        The airline launched its first domestic flight from Bombay to Trivandrum
        with a six-seater Miles Merlin. In 1938, it was re-christened as Tata
        Air Services and later as Tata Airlines. Colombo in Ceylon (now Sri
        Lanka) and Delhi were added to the destinations in 1938. During the
        Second World War, the airline helped the Royal Air Force with troop
        movements, shipping of supplies, rescue of refugees and maintenance of
        aircraft.After World War II, regular commercial service was restored in
        India and Tata Airlines became a public limited company on 29 July 1946
        under the name Air India. After Indian independence in 1947, 49% of the
        airline was acquired by the Government of India in 1948. On 8 June 1948,
        a Lockheed Constellation L-749A named Malabar Princess (registered
        VT-CQP) took off from Bombay bound for London Heathrow marking the
        airline's first international flight.

        In 1932, Air India started operations with a de Havilland Puss Moth. It
        inducted its first Boeing 707-420 named Gauri Shankar (registered
        VT-DJJ), thereby becoming the first Asian airline to induct a jet
        aircraft in its fleet and on 4 August 1993, Air India took the delivery
        of its first Boeing 747-400 named Konark (registered VT-ESM). Apart from
        the Boeing aircraft, Air India also operates a wide range of Airbus
        aircraft. In 1989, Indian Airlines introduced the Airbus A320-200
        aircraft, which Air India now uses to operate both domestic and
        international short haul flights. In 2005, Indian Airlines introduced
        smaller A319s, which are now used mainly on domestic and regional
        routes. After the merger in 2007, Air India inducted the biggest member
        of the A320 family, the A321, to operate mainly on international short
        haul and medium haul routes. At the same time, Air India leased Airbus
        A330s to operate on medium-long haul international routes. Currently Air
        India has many narrow body aircraft for domestic destinations like A320,
        A321 and A320 neo. Air India has also many wide body aircraft like
        Boeing 777-200LR, Boeing 777-300ER, Boeing 747-400 and Boeing 787-8
        mainly for international destinations. Air India Express, a subsidiary
        of Air India has a fleet of 25 Boeing 737-800
