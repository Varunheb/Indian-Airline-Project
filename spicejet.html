        2005. Indian media baron Kalanidhi Maran acquired a controlling stake in

      <h1 class="h--1">History</h1>
      <p class="p-one">
        The origins of SpiceJet can be tracked back to March 1984 when the
        company was established by Indian industrialist S. K. Modi to provide
        private air taxi services. On 17 February 1993, the company was named as
        MG Express and entered into technical partnership with the German flag
        carrier Lufthansa. The airline provided passenger and cargo services
        under the name of Modiluft before ceasing operations in 1996.

      <h1 class="in">Inception and Expansion</h1>
      <p class="inp">
        In 2004, the company was acquired by Ajay Singh and the airline planned
        to restart operations as SpiceJet following the low-cost model. SpiceJet
        leased two Boeing 737-800 aircraft in 2005 and planned to order 10 new
        aircraft for expansion. SpiceJet opened bookings on 18 May 2005 and the
        first flight was operated between Delhi and Mumbai on 24 May 2005. By
        July 2008, it was India's third-largest low-cost carrier in terms of
        market share after Air Deccan and IndiGo. Indian media baron Kalanidhi
        Maran acquired 37.7% stake in SpiceJet in June 2010 through Sun Group.
        The airline ordered 30 Boeing 737-8 aircraft worth US$2.7 billion July
        2010 and a further 15 Bombardier Q4 Dash short-haul aircraft worth
        US$446 million in December 2010. In 2012, SpiceJet suffered a loss of
        over ₹390 million (US$5.5 million) owing to increase in global crude
        prices. On 9 January 2012, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation,
        reported that several airlines in India, including SpiceJet, have not
        maintained crucial data for the flight operations quality assurance. The
        Bombay Stock Exchange announced that ever since June 2011, SpiceJet had
        been suffering losses. In 2012, Kalanidhi Maran increased his stake in
        the airline by investing ₹1 billion (US$14 million) in the airline. The
        airline returned to profits at the end of the same year. SpiceJet
        entered into an inter airline pact with Tigerair on 16 December 2013
        which was scrapped in January 2015.

      <h1 class="in">Services</h1>
      <p class="inp">
        SpiceJet has moved away from the typical low-cost carrier service model
        of economy class-only seating. The airline offers premium services under
        the name SpiceMax, whereby passengers can obtain additional benefits
        including pre-assigned seats with extra legroom; meals on board;
        priority check-in and boarding; and priority baggage handling; at a
        higher fare. Otherwise SpiceJet does not provide complimentary meals in
        any of its flights. It does sell full in-flight meals on some flights.
        SpiceJet operates its frequent-flyer programme but does not provide any
        in-flight entertainment options.

      <h1 class="in">Fleet</h1>
      <p class="inp">
        SpiceJet placed its first firm order for 20 Next-Generation Boeing
        737-800s in March 2005, with deliveries scheduled up to 2010. In
        November 2010, the airline ordered 30 Boeing 737-800s. On 9 December
        2010, Bombardier Aerospace announced that SpiceJet had placed a firm
        order for fifteen Q400 NextGen turboprop airliners with options for
        another fifteen. SpiceJet used its fleet of Q400s for short-haul
        operations. In March 2014, the airline signed a US$4.4 billion deal with
        Boeing for the procurement of 42 737 MAX 8 aircraft. In 2015, SpiceJet
        was in talks with both Boeing and Airbus for a possible order of more
        than 100 single aisle aircraft, either Airbus A320neo or the Boeing 737
        MAX with the same being confirmed by Managing Director, Ajay Singh, in a
        conference in Dubai.It is announced to induct 16 Boeing 737-800 NG in
        response to fulfil demands in local and international expansion. It was
        ordered due to the fleet of 737 MAX being currently banned and the
        downfall of Jet Airways. Due to the closure of all Jet Airways flights
        they have place orders for 6 additional Boeing 737-800 NG and 5 more
        Bombardier Q-400 in Dry Lease to cover the shortage in the Indian
        aviation industry.
