        Tata SIA Airlines Limited, operating as Vistara, is an Indian
        full-service airline, based in Gurgaon, with its hub at Indira Gandhi
        International Airport. The carrier, a joint venture between Tata Sons
        and Singapore Airlines, commenced operations on 9 January 2015 with its
        inaugural flight between Delhi and Mumbai. The airline had carried more
        than two million passengers by June 2016 and as of May 2019, has a 4.7%
        share of the domestic carrier market, making it the 6th largest domestic
        airline. The airline serves 34 destinations with a fleet of Airbus A320,
        Airbus A321neo, Boeing 787-9 and Boeing 737-800NG aircraft.

      <h2 class="vish">History</h2>
      <p class="visp">
        The airline was founded in 2013 as a joint venture (JV) between India's
        conglomerate Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines (SIA). The two companies
        had made a bid in the mid-1990s to launch a full-service carrier in
        India that was unsuccessful, being denied regulatory approval by the
        Indian government. With India opening up its airline sector for 49
        percent foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2012, Tata and SIA once again
        decided to float a JV airline company in India. The JV, Tata SIA
        Airlines Limited (TSAL), was envisaged as a premium full-service carrier
        to cater to the demands of high-end business travellers in India's civil
        aviation market dominated by low-cost carriers. India's Foreign
        Investment Promotion Board approved the JV in October 2013, allowing SIA
        to take a 49 percent stake in the airline. The two parent companies
        initially pledged to invest a combined US$100mnas start-up capital, with
        Tata Sons owning 51 percent and Singapore Airlines owning the remaining
        49 percent. This was part of Tata's second major foray into the aviation
        sector along with a minority stake in AirAsia India. The company's first
        venture, Tata Airlines, was established in the 1930s and later became
        the flag carrier Air India after nationalization.The company unveiled
        its brand identity "Vistara" on 11 August 2014. The name was taken from
        the Sanskrit word vistāra, meaning "limitless expanse". Vistara received
        its air operator's certificate from the Directorate General of Civil
        Aviation on 15 December 2014 and started operations on 9 January 2015.
        Vistara became the first carrier to operate domestic services out of the
        new Terminal 2 at Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport. On
        24 August 2015, Vistara inaugurated the Aviation Security Training
        Institute, an in-house institute for training its cockpit and cabin
        crew, security staff and others related to aviation industry. The
        institute has secured the necessary approvals from the nodal body Bureau
        of Civil Aviation Security. From the first month of operation, Vistara
        consistently achieved very high on-time performance records of over 90
        percent, the highest among India's domestic carriers. On 20 August 2015,
        Vistara declared it had carried half a million passengers in just over
        seven months of operations. As of February 2016, Vistara has a share of
        2% in the domestic carrier market.

        On 15 April 2014, Vistara chose Phee Teik Yeoh as the chief executive
        officer (CEO) and Giam Ming Toh as the chief commercial officer (CCO),
        both from Singapore Airlines. In March 2015, Vistara shifted to its new
        office at the One Horizon Center tower in Sector 43, Gurgaon, a
        satellite city of Delhi. Initially it started out with a three-member
        board comprising Swee Wah Mak (SIA group), Mukund Rajan and Prasad Menon
        (Tata group), with the latter as chairman. In August 2015, the airline
        expanded the board by introducing two new members, Som Mittal and
        Sangeeta Pendurkar, along with an equity infusion of ₹2 billion (US$28
        million), part of ₹5 billion (US$70 million) initially planned by Tata
        and SIA together. In January 2016, Bhaskar Bhat, present Managing
        Director of Titan, joined as the new chairman following Prasad Menon's
        retirement. In March 2016, Vistara appointed Sanjiv Kapoor as its chief
        strategy and commercial officer as the successor to Giam Ming Toh who
        was scheduled to leave in mid-April 2016 following completion of his
        deputation at Vistara.

        Vistara took delivery of its first aircraft at New Delhi on 25 September
        2014. The airline took delivery of the last of its thirteen original
        Airbus A320 aircraft in October 2016 and plans to receive its seven
        Airbus A320neo aircraft by mid-2018. In March 2015, Phee Teik Yeoh
        announced that the airline was planning to procure an unspecified number
        of both narrow-body and wide-body aircraft to enhance the domestic
        network and launch international flights within two years Vistara
        inducted nine former Jet Airways Boeing 737-800NG to its fleet following
        Jet Airway's grounding. Vistara returned two of these planes in January
        2020 and the remaining seven will exit the fleet between 2022-23 as they
        are on long term leases. Vistara Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner Vistara has a
        standing order of six 787-9 aircraft with Boeing, for delivery between
        2020 and 2021. The first of these Dreamliners were delivered in February
